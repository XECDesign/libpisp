Description: Helper library for the PiSP hardware block (development files)
 This library provides helper functions to generate hardware
 configuration for the PiSP hardware blocks.  The configuration
 includes a hardware register specification together with image tiling
 data to be programmed into the PiSP hardware to fully process a given
 Bayer or RGB/YUV image with a set of user defined configuration.
 .
 This package contains the development files.
